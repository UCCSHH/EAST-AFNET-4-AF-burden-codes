## Prerequisities

A R interpretater should be installed on your machine and we assume that you are familiar with R and the packages related to this work.


## Data

A fictitious dataset was generated and contains the necessary variables to carry out the analysis. The variables are constructed based on the original data structure from the EAST AFNET 4 data set.

Detailed description of the variables is available in the code file.

## Analysis Code

Analysis file **EAST_AF_burden_Analysis_Cox_landmark.R** is provided as R file, containing the relevant code and functions to load to reproduce the main analysis from the paper.
